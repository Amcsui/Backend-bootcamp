# SQL Practice

**Structured Exercises**:  
1. Write SQL queries to:
	- Find all flights longer than 500 minutes.
	- Update a flight’s duration.    
    - Delete canceled flights.
2. Use Python’s `sqlite3` to automate these queries in a script.

**Linked to Django**: Later, replicate these queries using Django ORM.
