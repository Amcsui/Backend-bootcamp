This assignment will guide you in creating your first personal GitHub portfolio. You'll get hands-on experience using GitHub, working with repositories, and using Git to push your code.

#### **Structured Exercises:**

1. **Create a GitHub Account**  
    If you don't already have one, [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/). This will be your platform for hosting your code and sharing your work with the world.
    
2. **Build a Repository**  
    Once you have your GitHub account:
    
    - Create a new repository (name it something like `personal-portfolio`).
        
    - Add a `README.md` file. This file should introduce yourself, your background, and your goals for the bootcamp. Make it personal, fun, and professional!
        
    - Create a Python script (something simple, like "Hello World" or a calculator). This will help you get familiar with how code is stored in repositories.
        
3. **Use Git to Push Your Code**  
    You can push your code either through Git commands or using the VS Code Git extensions. Here's a quick guide on pushing code to GitHub:
    
    - **Clone your repository** to your local machine using the command:
		```
		git clone <repository-link>
		```
	- **Add your files** (e.g., your `README.md` and Python script) to your repository.
    
	- Use the following commands to commit and push the code:
```
	git add -A
	git commit -m "Initial commit"
	git push origin main
```

1. **Build a Personal GitHub Portfolio**  
    After your repository is ready with your `README.md` and script, set up a personal GitHub portfolio:
    
    - You can use GitHub Pages to serve your portfolio site.
        
    - Follow [this GitHub Pages guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages) to set up and deploy your portfolio.
        

This assignment will help you get comfortable with GitHub and build a strong foundation for your coding journey. Good luck!
