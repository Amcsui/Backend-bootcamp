# **Number Guessing Game Assignment**  

In this assignment, you'll build a simple number guessing game using Python. This exercise will help you practice user input handling, loops, conditionals, and error handling.  

## **Structured Exercises:**  

1. **Generate a Random Number**  

      - Import the `random` module.  

      - Generate a random number between **1 and 100**.  


2. **User Guess Input**  
      - Ask the user to guess the number.  
      - Use an `if/else` statement to provide feedback:  
         - If the guess is too high, print `"Too high!"`.  
         - If the guess is too low, print `"Too low!"`.  
         - If the guess is correct, print `"Congratulations! You guessed it!"` and exit the loop.  

3. **Track Attempts**  
      - Use a `while` loop to keep the game running until the user guesses correctly.  
      - Count the number of attempts and display the total attempts when the user wins.

4. **Handle Invalid Inputs** (**Task**)
      - Modify the game to **only accept valid integers**.  
      - If the user enters a non-integer value (e.g., letters or symbols), show an error message and ask for input again **without crashing the program**.  

## **Bonus Challenge (Optional)**
- Set a limit (e.g., **5 attempts**) and end the game if the user doesn't guess the number within the limit.  
- Allow the user to **play again** without restarting the script.  

This assignment will strengthen your understanding of user input validation, loops, and conditionals. Good luck! ðŸš€
