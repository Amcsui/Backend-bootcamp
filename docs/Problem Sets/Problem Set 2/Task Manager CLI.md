# Task Manager CLI

## **Overview**  
In this exercise, you will build a **command-line task manager** using Python. Users can add, remove, list, and search tasks stored in a dictionary. You will also refactor the code to improve efficiency and structure.

## **Structured Exercises**  

### **1. Use a Dictionary to Store Tasks**  
   - Each task should have a unique **ID** (key) and a **description** (value).  

### **2. Implement Task Management Functions**  
   - **Add a task** (generate a unique ID).  
   - **Remove a task** by ID.  
   - **List all tasks** in a readable format.  
   - **Search for tasks** by keyword.  

### **3. Extra Features (Optional)**  
   - **Refactor with List Comprehensions**  
     - Optimize filtering/searching using **list comprehensions**.  
   - **Refactor to Use Classes**  
     - Replace the dictionary with a `TaskManager` class.  
   - **Save Tasks in a File**  
     - Store tasks in a JSON or text file.  
     - Implement functions in a separate **helper module** to handle file I/O.  

This exercise will help you practice **Python dictionaries, functions, refactoring, OOP, and file handling**. ðŸš€
