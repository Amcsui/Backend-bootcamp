# Job Board  

## **Overview**  
In this exercise, you will build a **Job Board** system where employers can post jobs, applicants can apply, and an admin can manage job postings and applications.  

## **Requirements**  

### **1. Authentication & User Roles**  
   - Implement **user authentication** (login, logout, registration).  
   - Use **Djangoâ€™s built-in authentication system**.  
   - Create two user roles using **groups and permissions**:  
     - **Employers**: Can post jobs.  
     - **Applicants**: Can apply to jobs.  

### **2. Admin Panel Customization**  
   - Modify the Django **admin panel** to display **pending job applications**.  
   - Add **custom admin actions**:  
     - Approve or reject job applications.  
     - Approve or reject job postings.  

### **3. Testing**  
   - Write **unit tests and integration tests** for all major functionalities.  
   - Test **authentication workflows** (registration, login, role-based access).  
   - Test **admin actions** (approving/rejecting jobs and applications).  

This project will help you practice **Django authentication, role-based access control, admin customization, and testing**. ðŸš€
